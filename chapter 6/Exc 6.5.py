'''The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides
both of them with no remainder.
One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that if r is the remainder when
a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b,r). As a base case, we can use gcd(a, 0) = a.'''


def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    r = a % b
    return gcd(b, r)


print(gcd(22, 36))
